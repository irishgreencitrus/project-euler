# Project Euler Problem Five
Link to problem: https://projecteuler.net/problem=5

I hate this problem so much, because when i was researching how to do this in haskell, i found the insane answer that you see in `main.hs`. It uses list folding which calculates the solution insanely quicker than my other method (see `main.py`). I then converted the haskell solution to rust map and elixir and python. Also while doing this i realised how stupidly slow powershell scripting is, even being slower than python.
