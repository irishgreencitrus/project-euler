# Project Euler Problem Two
Link to problem: https://projecteuler.net/problem=2
This problem was considerably harder than the first using functions or the languages equivilent. My least favorite out of these is definately the python list comprehension one, as it is really just an equivilent of the haskell one but using itertools. The Elixir solution for this problem looks much nicer than the one for the first, showing how i probably took the wrong approach for the first problem but oh well. To my suprise, all of the languages support recursive functions, even lua which i did not expect considering how small the compiler is. My favorite solution is the haskell solution as it's really neat just taking up four lines and still being readable. Even though the python solution does the same thing it is so much less readable and also uses an import which is kind of gross.
