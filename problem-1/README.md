# Project Euler Problem One
These are all of my solutions for https://projecteuler.net/problem=1
written in 15 different ways. Most of these are different languages, however Rust/ Rust Map are just ways of doing the same thing in Rust and Python/ Python List Comprehension are just different ways of doing it in Python. I've probably approached Elixir's solution entirely wrong because it's meant to be a functional language, and i don't know if what i've done classes as functional so oops. The Haskell solution is closest to the Rust Map one, and the Python List Comprehension one. My favorite solution is probably the Haskell one as it's a one liner and is just clever. My least favorite solution is the Elixir one because i don't think its how you're meant to use Elixir.
